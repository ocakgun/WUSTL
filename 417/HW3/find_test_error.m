function [ test_error ] = find_test_error( w, X, y )
%FIND_TEST_ERROR Find the test error of a linear separator
%   This function takes as inputs the weight vector representing a linear
%   separator (w), the test examples in matrix form with each row
%   representing an example (X), and the labels for the test data as a
%   column vector (y). X does not have a column of 1s as input, so that 
%   should be added. The labels are assumed to be plus or minus one. 
%   The function returns the error on the test examples as a fraction. The
%   hypothesis is assumed to be of the form (sign ( [1 x(n,:)] * w )
	N = size(y,1);
	X = [ones(N,1), X];
	y_ = X * w';
	for i=1:N
		if y_(i)>0.5
			y_(i) = 1;
		else
			y_(i) = -1;
		end
	end
	t = (y - y_)/2;
	test_error = sum(t.*t)/N;
